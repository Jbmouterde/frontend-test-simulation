## Instructions
Your goal is to create a client to consume an existing API, and provide a UI to showcase some info from that server.

The deliverable will be a simple Angular app with one view, where the user is presented with a 'PokeView' component, which will present a nice list of ten random pokemon from the PokemonAPI. 

The list will be fetch ten random pokemon when the view is rendered, and show some basic data to the user - name, type, and whatever others you think are nice to show. 
Additionally, the user will be able to click a button to fetch ten new entries that will replace the current ones on the view.
If you've finished this, feel free to add some more functionality such as getting a specific pokemon based on user input, or anything else.

* The emphasis here is on quality code and good practices, and not on the end result. Make sure you structure your project well and consider using TDD with the built-in Angular unit tests. Make sure you know how to communicate whatever you are doing *

### Step 1
Check out this API documentation of https://pokeapi.co/

### Step 2
Plan the architecture of your app - what goes in a component, what goes in a service.

### Step 3
Start implementing
